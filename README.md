# iNaturalist Data Explorer

This is the repo for the iNaturalist Data Explorer site. This project is part of the [Open Life Science mentoring program](https://openlifesci.org/ols-4).


## Project Goals

Citizen science aims to give the general public a chance to participate in science. But by limiting the participation to just data collecting, and leaving data analysis to "real" scientists, that can further reinforce the divide between the non-scientists and scientists. iNaturalist Data Explorer is a website that allows [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org) project organizers to import their iNaturalist data, upload education materials, and add pre-built interactive data exploration tools for their project. By giving citizen scientists the chance to explore the data that they help collect, I hope citizen scientists will be encouraged to form their own questions, look for answers to their own questions, and thereby create a more engaging experience for both participants and organizers.
