var e=`The Global Ocean Surface Ecosystem Alliance (GO-SEA) is a NASA-funded community science project supporting ocean-lovers as they explore their ocean backyard. Together, we aim to discover both our local ocean-surface ecosystems and build a global map of life on the ocean's surface.

Check out our [Field Guide](https://goseascience.org/field-guide/) to learn more about mysterious ocean surface creatures. Many are brightly colored and can be spotted by beachcombers and sailors. When members find these organisms, they upload their observations to our iNaturalist page. If they go to sea but don't see any of these organisms, members share one cool sighting as a way to document their trip. Not only is it fun to share your favorite finds, sharing when you do and don't find surface life will help you build patterns of presence and absence observations in your area. Our team of scientists and software engineers will pair your observations with weather and surface current data, so you can discover WHY you may find surface life only in certain areas, or only at certain times of the year. In building a forecasting map for ocean surface life in your ocean backyard, you'll be joining a movement of ocean lovers as we create the world's first map of global ocean surface life.
