var e=[{name:"Porpita",text:`Blue button jellies, known by their scientific name Porpita, float on the ocean\u2019s surface using a round disc, and drift where the current takes them. Unlike Velella they do not have a sail, so they are less commonly found far north and far south, and are most abundant in the tropics. Porpita prey on small swimming crustaceans, and produce small jellyfish which reproduce to develop more floating Porpita. While most Porpita are blue, white buttons and gold buttons are not uncommon.

Below the sail a collection of tentacles surround a central mouth, and they love to eat small fish and fish eggs. Each Velella can also bud off many tiny jellyfish from its underside, which reproduce to form new baby floating Velella.

Velella can be seen on coasts around the world. They are less common in the tropics, and more abundant in temperate waters. Rarely, they can be found as far north as Alaska and as far south as southern New Zealand. Very small Velella have been described as \u2018sticky blue sand\u2019, and are no bigger than sugar crystals. Large Velella can be longer than a human hand.
