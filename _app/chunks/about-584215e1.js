var e=`## Intro

Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve is a University of Minnesota biological field station with many ecosystems and species found throughout the forests and grasslands of North America. Faculty, staff and students who work at Cedar Creek are dedicated to finding sustainable solutions to the world\u2019s environmental challenges, using the tools of research, conservation, education and community engagement.

Although Cedar Creek is best known for its academic research, there are many opportunities for community members to participate in activities onsite, including data collection and exploration. Volunteers on citizen science projects like our wildlife tracking survey have used iNaturalist for data collection and recording since 2016. These observations, along with incidental observations submitted by hikers, birdwatchers, staff, students and scientists, form the basis of this data exploration tool. We hope you enjoy exploring some of the animals and plants of the reserve, along with some basic environmental and climate data!

_Disclaimer: the data displayed here is updated periodically throughout the year but it is not live. Observations you submit may not be available on this interface for several months._
